Chatbot as  clojure/clojurescript/re-frame web-application with server/client part connected via websocket. Figwheel for debugging.

Tested with java 1.8 and leiningen 2.8.1, Chrome

Project based on a leiningen template containing server, debugging and testing
lein new re-frame fullstack +10x +handler +test


## Development Mode

### Run application:

```
lein clean
lein figwheel dev
```

Figwheel will automatically push cljs changes to the browser.
Wait a bit, then browse to [http://localhost:3448](http://localhost:3448).

In the repl invoke the function
```
(fullstack.dev-server/start-dev)
```

Note that you could run a repl in emacs via cider through M-x cider-jack-in or C-c M-j.


### Run tests:

Install karma and headless chrome
```
npm install -g karma-cli
npm install karma karma-cljs-test karma-chrome-launcher --save-dev
```

And then run your tests

```
lein clean
lein doo chrome-headless test once
```

Please note that [doo](https://github.com/bensu/doo) can be configured to run cljs.test in many JS environments (phantom, chrome, ie, safari, opera, slimer, node, rhino, or nashorn).


## Production Build

```
lein clean
lein uberjar
```

That should compile the clojurescript code first, and then create the standalone jar.
If it's not set, it will run on port 3448 by default.

To compile clojurescript to javascript:

```
lein clean
lein cljsbuild once min
```
These jobs are defined in the project.clj. So lein uberjar suffices.


### Run production build

run the compiled uberjar with
```
java -cp "./*" fullstack.server &
```
in the directory target. Or
```
java -tar fullstack.jar fullstack.server &
```

Then browse to http://localhost:port where port is defined as prod-port in config

### ToDo
 * Add jdbc and datomic
